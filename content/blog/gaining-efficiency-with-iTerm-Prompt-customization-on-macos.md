I recently moved from Ubuntu to MacOS and found a whole new world of gestures and shortcuts that really made me work at a different level speed, so I decided to explore also new possibilities for my terminal.
I moved from Terminator, which I used for years in Ubuntu with a common bash prompt. In the process of setting up my new laptop I tested several options and I found that iTerm and Oh-my-zsh were the right choices for me.

iTerm and Zsh
MacOS includes a default command prompt, Terminal, which is the interface to the bash command prompt. A popular alternative to bash is to use Oh My Zsh, an open-source community-driven framework for managing the config of the popular ZSH prompt on UNIX. It has tons of functions, helpers, plugins, themes, …, everything to build your own custom prompt.
iTerm is the MacOS Terminal replacement, also community backed and very configurable.
