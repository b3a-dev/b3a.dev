You need to carry out a project with a new team and want it to be productive from day zero, however the steps necessary to achieve it are not easy. Starting by finding the profiles that will be part of your team. How to design an effective selection process? Will they be the right people? Will i have been wrong? Once inside we want them to write commits and contribute ideas as soon as possible and for this it will be important to make a good on-boarding process.
