What a better way to learn about blockchain that implementing one? This talk is distributed in three sections and covers from basic concepts, to all those fancy words that souround blockchain nowadays, explaining them in a simple way. The implementation examples are in python, and use Docker containers as deployment method. 

Once we have our chain we do not only want to interact with it, we also want to build a whole network, working with the consensus algorithm.
