Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence Assistants have become part of our day a day lives. Alexa (Amazon), Siri (Apple), Watson assistant(IBM), Google assistant (Google), Cortana (MS), we ask them to call someone while we are driving, to get us to a place, to play some music, but also to show us pictures of us with John Doe, and they recognise him in the pictures and show us only those in which he is present, we also ask for the purchase in the supermarket and the products are delivered home hours laterâ€¦ This talk pursues to raise awareness of the huge amount of data we provide and the dangerous possible consequences. And also how accessible is this technology by showcasing how to build a AI powered bot with Google assistant.
