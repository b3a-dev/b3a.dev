In the world of cloud-native applications and microservices, Prometheus has become the standard for monitoring.
This talk shows why, and what differentiates it from the more traditional approaches. How it can be used to monitor both systems and applications, and how to develop Prometheus-native applications.
It also shows the best practices when designing alert systems and integrate them with incident management tools that maybe already deployed.

Don’t miss it, the best "take-home moral" about monitoring is awaiting.
